## Hi there 👋

I'm Jordi, a Full-Stack Developer with several years of experience building modern web applications across frontend and backend systems.

I recently completed an M.Sc. in Data Science, which strengthened my data-driven mindset and sparked a strong interest in AI-powered applications, particularly those involving large language models (LLMs).

### 🚀 About this GitHub
This repository showcases a collection of side projects I’ve designed and developed outside of my professional work, including:

- 🎓 **Academic work** – university projects, including my Master’s thesis
- 🤖 **Hackathon & experimental apps** – AI-driven applications integrating LLMs and data science techniques
- 📦 **Business solutions** – a warehouse management system currently used by my family’s business
- 🏛️ **Community projects** – such as a church event registration system used by a local church
